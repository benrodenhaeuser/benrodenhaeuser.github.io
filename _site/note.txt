Overall, it should be done like in blog_test_copy, essentially.

So it looks like we could work with this repo, simply?

get rid of the jekyll theme:

- config.yml

  - delete line 1 specifying the theme
  - add:

    sass
    sass_dir: _scss

- make dir _scss

  this is where the main style file "style.css" lives. it imports everything else

- in the css directory in assets, we need a file main.scss.

  this needs to import style.css


- in the head layout:

  - change "style.css" to "main.css"
