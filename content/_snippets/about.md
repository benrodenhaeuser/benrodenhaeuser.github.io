title: Hello! My name is Ben.

I am a software engineer that

- gets energized from shipping (but does not sacrifice thoughtfulness for velocity),
- has unlimited energy to get to the bottom of things (but knows when to stop digging deeper),
- likes to carefully analyze trade-offs (but does not get stuck in analysis paralysis),
- takes the work very seriously (but not too seriously).

I am based in Berlin and currently open for remote or hybrid opportunities. I love working on the web platform, but am always eager to learn any skills required to get the job done.

Most recently, I was employed at [Pitch][1] for four years, where I helped ship a number of important user-facing features in areas such as animations, video blocks, and image editing, but also worked on several “under-the-hood” projects including frontend modularization, client-side routing and data exchange formats.
