I am a Software Engineer based in Berlin.

- I am Software Engineer proficient in JavaScript, Ruby, and PostgreSQL. I am a fast and effective learner and proficient problem-solver, and love to work on challenging projects. 
- I am also an experienced writer, researcher, and creative director for web and print projects. 
- Most recent project is Pen, an in-browser vector design tool that live-syncs a drawing canvas with an SVG markup editor. I built Pen from scratch in JavaScript, developing a custom application framework based on solid design patterns. Check out the case study below. 

I am currently looking for new opportunities, and would love to [hear from you][1].
