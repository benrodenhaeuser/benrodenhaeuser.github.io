title: Hello! My name is Ben.

I am a software engineer that
- gets energized from shipping (but does not sacrifice thoughtfulness for velocity),
- has unlimited energy to get to the bottom of things (but knows when to stop digging deeper),
- likes to carefully analyze trade-offs (but does not get stuck in analysis paralysis),
- takes the work very serious (but not too serious).

I am based in Berlin and currently open for remote or hybrid opportunities. I love working on the frontend, but am always eager to learn any skills required to get the job done.

Most recently, I was employed at [Pitch][1] for four years, where I helped ship a number of important user-facing features such as animations, video and image cropping, but also worked on several “under-the-hood” projects including frontend modularization, client-side routing and data exchange formats.

Before my time at Pitch, I spent some time working on a personal project that I am still quite proud of: Pen, an in-browser vector design tool that live-syncs a drawing canvas with an SVG markup editor. Have a look at my extended [case study][2] below.

I am excited about the prospect of new collaborations. Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn][3] or [email][4]. I'd love to discuss how I can contribute to your team!
