I am a Software Engineer at [Pitch][1] in Berlin.

My most recent personal project is Pen, an in-browser vector design tool that live-syncs a drawing canvas with an SVG markup editor, integrating “design” and “code” in one app. I built Pen from scratch in JavaScript, developed a custom SPA framework for state and event management, and implemented performance improvements using functional programming techniques. Have a look at my extended [case study][2]!

Feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn][3] or [email][4].
