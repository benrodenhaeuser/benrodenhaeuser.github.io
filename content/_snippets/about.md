I am a software engineer based in Berlin and currently open for remote or hybrid opportunities. I love working on the web platform, and projects at the intersection of engineering and design hold a special place in my heart.

Most recently, I was employed at [Pitch][1] for four years, where I helped ship important user-facing features (e.g., animations and image editing) and improvements to the frontend architecture (e.g.,frontend modularization, client-side router).

To learn more about me, have a look at my [CV][5] and my [LinkedIn][3] profile. Also, feel free to get in touch via [email][4]!
