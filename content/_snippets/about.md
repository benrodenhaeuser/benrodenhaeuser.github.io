I am a software engineer based in Berlin and currently open for remote or hybrid opportunities. I love working on the web platform. Projects at the intersection of engineering and design holds a special place in my heart.

Most recently, I was employed at [Pitch][1] for four years, where I helped ship a number of important user-facing features in areas such as animations, video blocks, and image editing, but also worked on several “under-the-hood” projects including frontend modularization, client-side routing and data exchange formats.

To learn more about me, have a look at my [CV][5] and my [LinkedIn][3] profile. Feel free to get in touch via [email][4]!
