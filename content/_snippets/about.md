I am a Software Engineer in Berlin.

- I am a fast and effective learner and capable problem-solver, and love to work on challenging projects.
- My most recent project is Pen, an in-browser vector design tool that live-syncs a drawing canvas with an SVG markup editor, integrating “design” and “code” in one app. I built Pen from scratch in JavaScript, developed a custom SPA framework for state and event management, and implemented performance improvements using functional programming techniques. Have a look at my extended [case study][1]! 
- I am also an experienced writer, researcher, and creative director for web and print projects. 
- You can find more information about me in my resume, and on my LinkedIn and GitHub pages. 

I am currently looking for new opportunities, and would love to [hear from you][2].
