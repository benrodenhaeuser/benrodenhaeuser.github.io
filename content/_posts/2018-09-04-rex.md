description: A regular expression engine based on finite state automata wrapped in a grep-style CLI.
abstract: Rex is a command line application written in Ruby that searches plain text based on regular exressions. It is modeled on the popular grep utility. Using well-known patterns and algorithms, it compiles the regular expression provided into a finite state automaton, and produces customizable results listings.
